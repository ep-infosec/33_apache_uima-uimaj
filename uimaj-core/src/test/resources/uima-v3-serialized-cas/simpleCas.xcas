These resources will facilitate development of Internet2 applications and participation in the Internet2 project.  The grant recipients are Clemson University in South Carolina, Duke University in North Carolina, Indiana University, Northwestern University in Illinois, the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan, and the University of South Carolina.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;      Donated resources will be in the form of hardware, software, switches and other pieces of network infrastructure critical to Internet2 applications, connections, and operation.  In addition, grant recipients have access to the technological expertise of IBM personnel. Many of the grant recipients will use the donations to create networked consortiums with other higher educational institutions in their areas.  Grant resources will be used to enhance specific advanced technology applications -- ranging from telemedicine to the maintenance of a digital Movietone newsreel archive.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;      Irving Wladawsky-Berger, general manager of IBM's Internet Division, emphasized the company's commitment to the  new  Internet.  He said,  The Internet has succeeded beyond our wildest imagination.  More and more people are getting connected around the world, as the Internet is being embraced across the research community, educational institutions, businesses of all sizes, and society at large.  The Internet2 efforts will take us all to the next levels, with significant improvements in bandwidth and quality of service.  Most important, the Internet2 efforts will make possible all kinds of new, exciting applications.  IBM is very proud to continue its associations and contributions to the Internet.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;      Sean C. Rush, general manager of IBM Global Education, agrees.  He said,  Internet2 is being developed with the needs of higher education inmind.  Internet2 capabilities include high speed, dependability, and networking power.  For example, data base analysis that took hours or days will take minutes.  Researchers worldwide will be able to share large amounts of data without interruptions or slow downs.  And finally, Internet2 will serve as an important repository for a wealth of materials, and researchers will now have high quality, high speed access to books, art work, films, and music.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;      Don Haile, vice president of IBM's Networking Hardware Development, has worked closely with several Internet2 universities over the past year.  The recent revolutions in networking technology, including the advent of ATM, switched LANs and route-switching, are allowing today's university faculty to consider network-based applications that they previously only dreamed about,  said Don.    Professors can transmit voice and video in real time over a network, enriching research collaborations and distance learning classroom experiences.   By providing high speed communication links,  Internet2 is supporting research that will benefit students and local communities, across the country.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;  Internet2   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;      Since its recent inception, Internet2 has grown from 34 to over 100 research universities.  With Internet2, network applications are better served by new network points-of-presence (PoPs) capable of transmitting gigabits (billions of bits) of information per second.  Internet2 participants broaden their research and development expenditures to help create these GigaPoPs. Member universities, working with private member companies and non-profit organizations are developing tools for scientific research and higher education in the 21st century.
